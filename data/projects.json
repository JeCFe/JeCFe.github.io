Using AdaFruit CircuitPython I built code that would take GPIO inputs and process them into simulated keyboard inputs, using this to perform shortcuts, control media, open applications, and control of windows.",

First iteration was made on this project as an introductory learning into React and JavaScript, with this new approach I have rewritten the code into TypeScript and Tailwind using best coding practices, striving for better abstractions and readability. Using signalling to allow the cancellation of the sorting animations mid-flow, was a major bug with the first iteration that was managed in the new one. Current support array sorting methods include Merge, Quick, Bubble, Heap, Insertion, and Selection sort, each one uses an array of render bars at different heights to sort with animations to show each step.",
